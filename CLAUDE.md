# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code).

## Agents

IMPORTANT: Use the available agents proactively and liberally! They are there to help you.

## Language- and tool-specific instructions

IMPORTANT: You MUST always consider and follow the rules for the specific languages and tools you are using or working with.

Available rules:

- Typescript: @~/.claude/rules/typescript.md
- Svelte/Sveltekit: @~/.claude/rules/svelte.md
- Effect: @~/.claude/rules/effect.md
- Plain CSS: @~/.claude/rules/css.md (Only read this when you are working with plain CSS. For example, not needed when only working with Tailwind CSS.)
- Vite: @~/.claude/rules/vite.md

## Task-specific instructions

IMPORTANT: When you need information about the codebase or want to determine how something is implemented, use the context-fetcher agent!

## General Rules

- Do not change directories if you can avoid it. If it is necessary to do so for fulfilling a task, go back after having completed it.
