## Task-specific instructions

IMPORTANT: When you need information about the codebase or want to determine how something is implemented, use the context-fetcher agent!

## General Rules

- Do not change directories if you can avoid it. If it is necessary to do so for fulfilling a task, go back after having completed it.
