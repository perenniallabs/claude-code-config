# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code).

## Language- and tool-specific instructions

IMPORTANT: Always read and follow the rules for the specific languages and tools you are working with if available. Only read the rules that are relevant to the task at hand. Do this **BEFORE** starting any implementation.

Available rules:
Typescript: @~/.claude/rules/typescript.md
Svelte/Sveltekit: @~/.claude/rules/svelte.md
Effect: @~/.claude/rules/effect.md
Plain CSS: @~/.claude/rules/css.md (Only read this when you are working with plain CSS. For example, not needed when only working with Tailwind CSS.)
Vite: @~/.claude/rules/vite.md

## Task-specific instructions

IMPORTANT: When you need information about the codebase or want to determine how something is implemented, use the context-fetcher agent!

## General Rules

- Do not change directories if you can avoid it. If it is necessary to do so for fulfilling a task, go back after having completed it.
